# Introduction
I am interested in tracking and pressure releases. Pressure releases are the topological formations found within and around a track that record the speed, direction and body position of the individual who made the track at that moment in time.

I was introduced to the the ideas of tracking pressure releases from a book entitled: The Science and Art of Tracking by Tom Brown, Jr. ISBN 0-425-15772-5.
I have no affilation. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it if you are interested in learning more about tracking/pressure releases.

The book introduces the idea of creating a tracking pit (or area) to study and learn how to read, understand and internalize these formations.
This is further expanded to include three substraites to practice in: wet hard packed sand, wet semi-soft sand, and dry loose sand.
These three substraites form a continuium of the vast variety of substraites you may be tracking in. Ranging from tracking in the dust on a hard packed road, to tracking in loose leaf litter.

I think, a tracking pit should:
- be large, allowing you or a family pet to run, jump, roll, etc. 
- convienent to access and use at any time of day or night
- safe/comfortable
- allow for lighting control (full light, or directed light from extreme angles, etc.)
- fits in the space available.
I've used beaches, deserts, dirt-floored pole barns, outdoor volleyball courts, gardens, fields, and sandboxes.
All have their own advantages and disadvantages.
For me, the key is to make it as easy to use and access as possible. Tracking is hard work, requiring lots of "dirt time". 
If my tracking pit requires a 5 mile hike to get to, then my mind will come up with reasons not to go today.
If my tracking pit is cold, wet, swarming with mosquitoes, I find that I don't go or don't stay long.
If my tracking pit is not accessable when it is dark, I am not going to have time due to other work resposibilities 
If I can't see it from the kitchen, it is out of sight and out of mind. 
Make it as convienent and confortable as possible. Do what you can do.

In my current living conditions I do not have access to a big convienent location.
This page documents my current setup.
